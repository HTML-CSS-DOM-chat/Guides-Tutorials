<h2>A bit of history</h2>

You may think that Flexbox is just a new experimental CSS3 technology; I have not been able to find a copy of the original specification of Flexbox, but it probably dates back to 10-15 years ago, when the web had not reached yetÂ the potential of these days. I hope someone will help me to glean some infos about it while reading this series of articles, because I searched for hours, but I couldn't find anything trustable.

Those years we thought that the internet had reached already its full maturity, but those times seem today light years away. Internet was basically a bunch of advertising pages, but today interactivity is increased and every day we see the birth of new sites that are actually real programs once unthinkable in a web browser.

<strong>Flexbox born both for a real purpose, and for the foresight to see the future of the web.</strong> In fact, although its immediate utility was to create the layout for XUL applications (like Firefox , Thunderbird and thousands of related extensions ) it was possible already to see the real purpose of this technology: <strong>the web would become more interactive and it would be needed an efficient and intelligent way to create layouts of applications</strong>.

CSS2 has many limitations due to its document-oriented nature; the web was not designed to create applications. If XMLHTTP ( AJAX ) has revolutionized the use of JavaScript, Flexbox will revolutionize the use of CSS. The document-oriented CSS also becomes app-oriented now. <strong>If in the past it wasn't a necessity to create toolbar, advanced modules, panels and datagrids, nowadays has become a priority, and Flexbox comes to the rescue</strong>.

<em><strong>Flexbox is the potential solution to many problems of layout so far impossible to solve with CSS2</strong></em>

In this series of articles will be shown how to design a very special layout created exclusively using Flexbox, together to all its benefits and its operating logic.

Although I've used Flexbox with XUL for years, even for me this is a new world, so I'll try to guide you in the intricate design issues looking at them with the eyes of a complete newbie.
