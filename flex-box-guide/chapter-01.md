##A bit of history

You may think that `flexbox` is an experimental `CSS3` technology, however its origins date back at least 10-15 years, when the web was still in its infancy. If anyone knows the true origin of `flexbox` please feel free to leave a comment, I searched for hours, but I couldn't find anything solid.

Back then it was thought that the internet had reached its full maturity. On reflection the internet was basically a bunch of advertising pages. Today, interactivity has increased and every day sees the birth of new websites that act like real applications, which was once unthinkable in a web browser.

`flexbox` was born to resolve a real problem, whilst having the foresight to aid the future of the web.

In fact its immediate purpose was to create layouts for XUL applications (like Firefox , Thunderbird and thousands of related extensions ) it was possible already to see the real purpose of this technology and its use in the future: 

**The web would become more interactive and we would needed an efficient and intelligent way to create layouts for our applications**.

`CSS2` has many limitations due to its document-oriented nature; the web was not designed to create applications. If `XMLHTTP` ( ajax ) has revolutionized the use of JavaScript, `flexbox` should revolutionize the use of CSS. 

The document-oriented CSS used for several years, also has to serve the purpose of application-oriented CSS. In the past it wasn't a necessity to create user interfaces like, toolbar, advanced modules, panels and datagrids. However at present this is a priority, and `flexbox` may come to the rescue.

**Flexbox has the potential to solve many problems of complex layouts, which are seen as impossible to solve with CSS2.**

In this series of articles will be designing a very special layout created exclusively using `flexbox`, highlighting all of its benefits and operating logic.

Although I've used Flexbox with XUL for years, this is a new world to me, so I'll try to my best to guide you with what could be a very important component of the websites of tomorrow.

###What specification?###

Using `flexbox` today could be a real pain, since there are 3 major implementations / specifications, each very different.

The first specification is vendor prefixed, so our CSS would require maintance, which isn't ideal.

**In this series we shall be looking at the last specification. We shall be this specification to create an application based design, such as an administration panel for a website, where old browser support isn't a priority.**
